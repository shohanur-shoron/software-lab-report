**3.2.1. AI-Powered Conversational Interest Discovery:**
*   **Description:** Users will engage in a natural language chat with an AI assistant (powered by an LLM like Gemini). They can describe their reading interests, preferred themes, writing styles, or even their current mood.
*   **Mechanism:** The AI will analyze the user's input, ask clarifying questions if needed, and then suggest relevant book categories from a predefined, curated list. It will explain why these categories are relevant to the user's stated preferences. Users can then request example book titles within these suggested categories.
*   **Benefit:** Moves beyond keyword search or simple filter selection to a more nuanced and interactive method of preference elicitation, helping users uncover categories they might not have known existed or precisely articulated.

**3.2.2. Intelligent Book Recommendations:**
*   **Description:** Based on the user's explicitly stated interests (selected categories via AI chat or manual profile settings) and potentially their interaction history (e.g., liked books, reading status), the system will present personalized book recommendations on their homepage and other relevant sections.
*   **Mechanism:** Initially, this will be content-based filtering (matching book categories to user interests). Future iterations could incorporate collaborative filtering.
*   **Benefit:** Provides users with a tailored feed of books that are more likely to align with their tastes, reducing search fatigue.

**3.2.3. Agentic AI for Library Management:**
*   **Description:** A specialized AI agent will allow users to manage their personal library (favorite books, reading lists) using simple, natural language commands within a dedicated chat interface.
*   **Mechanism:** Users can issue commands like:
    *   "Add 'The Lord of the Rings' to my favorites."
    *   "Show me the books I am currently reading."
    *   "Mark '1984' as completed."
    *   "What books do I have on my to-read list?"
    *   "Remove 'Dune' from my favorites."
    The AI agent (backend LLM integration) will parse these commands, identify the intent and entities (book titles, list types, actions), execute the corresponding database operations (add/remove/update records), and provide a conversational confirmation or summary of the action taken, streamed in real-time.
*   **Benefit:** Offers an intuitive, fast, and powerful way to manage personal book collections without navigating through multiple menus or forms. Particularly useful for quick updates and queries.

**3.2.4. Multimodal Book Identification (Image-to-Info):**
*   **Description:** Users will be able to upload an image of a book cover (e.g., a photo taken with their phone) or capture one using their device's camera.
*   **Mechanism:** The image will be sent to an LLM with vision capabilities (e.g., Gemini Vision). The AI will analyze the image, attempt to identify the book, and return relevant information about it (title, author, description, etc.).
*   **Benefit:** Provides a novel and convenient way to quickly get information about a physical book encountered in a bookstore, a friend's house, or elsewhere, bridging the physical and digital book worlds.

**3.2.5. Comprehensive User Profiles and Interest Management:**
*   **Description:** Users will have detailed profiles where they can manage personal information, profile picture, and explicitly define their reading interests by selecting from a list of curated book categories.
*   **Mechanism:** Standard Django user model extended with a Profile model. Interests will be stored as a many-to-many relationship.
*   **Benefit:** User profiles serve as the foundation for personalization and allow users to explicitly guide the recommendation engine.

**3.2.6. Reading Status Tracking and Progress Monitoring:**
*   **Description:** Users can track the status of books in their personal library: 'To Read', 'Currently Reading', or 'Completed'. For 'Currently Reading' books, they can log their current page progress.
*   **Mechanism:** A dedicated `ReadingStatus` model will link users and books, storing the status and progress. APIs will allow for easy updates.
*   **Benefit:** Helps users stay organized, monitor their reading habits, and derive satisfaction from their reading achievements.

**3.2.7. Rich Review and Sentiment Analysis System:**
*   **Description:** Users can write textual reviews and provide star ratings for books they have read.
*   **Mechanism:** A `Comment` model will store reviews. Upon submission, the text of the review will be processed by a sentiment analysis tool (e.g., VADER) to determine a sentiment score and category (positive, negative, neutral), which will also be stored.
*   **Benefit:** Fosters a community around books, allows users to share opinions, and provides valuable aggregated sentiment data about books to other users.

**3.2.8. Advanced Search and Browsing Capabilities:**
*   **Description:** Users will be able to search for books using a flexible search bar. They will also be able to browse books by category or discover new titles through a dedicated "discover" section.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Fuzzy search will be implemented to handle typos and partial matches.
    *   Dynamic search suggestions will appear as the user types.
    *   Category browsing will list books within selected genres.
    *   A "discover" page will showcase books *outside* a user's primary interests to encourage exploration.
*   **Benefit:** Provides multiple avenues for users to find books, catering to both specific searches and serendipitous discovery.
