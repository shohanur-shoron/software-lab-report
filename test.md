**9.1. Software and Cloud Services:**
*   Python, Django.
*   Google Generative AI (Gemini) API access (requires API key and potentially associated costs depending on usage beyond free tiers).
*   Git and a remote repository provider (e.g., GitHub).
*   PythonAnywhere hosting account.
*   Standard development text editors/IDEs.
**9.2. Hardware (Development Machines):**
*   Standard laptops/desktop computers capable of running web browsers, IDEs, and development servers.
*   Webcams (for testing image capture for Book Finder feature).
**9.3. Human Resources (Skills):**
*   **Member A:** Strong Python/Django backend development skills, experience or willingness to learn AI/LLM API integration, database design, RESTful API principles, asynchronous programming (SSE).
*   **Member B:** Strong HTML, CSS, JavaScript frontend development skills, experience with DOM manipulation, AJAX, client-side API integration, UI/UX design principles.
*   Both members: Problem-solving skills, ability to learn new technologies quickly, good communication and collaboration.
10. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
**10.1. Technical Challenges:**
    *   **Challenge:** Complexity of prompt engineering for reliable AI agent behavior.
        *   **Mitigation:** Iterative design and testing of prompts. Start with simpler commands and gradually increase complexity. Detailed logging of AI interactions.
    *   **Challenge:** Latency in external AI API responses affecting user experience.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use streaming responses (SSE) wherever possible. Optimize prompts. Explore caching for non-highly dynamic AI outputs. Clearly indicate loading states in the UI.
    *   **Challenge:** Securely managing AI API keys.
        *   **Mitigation:** **PRIORITY:** For client-side AI calls, implement a backend proxy endpoint. For server-side calls, use environment variables immediately and avoid committing keys to Git.
    *   **Challenge:** Handling errors and unexpected outputs from LLMs.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling in API call wrappers. Design fallback mechanisms. Allow users to retry or rephrase if an AI interaction fails.
**10.2. Data Challenges:**
    *   **Challenge:** Populating an initial book catalog for meaningful recommendations and search.
        *   **Mitigation:** Start with a smaller, manually curated dataset for development. Plan for integration with book data APIs (e.g., Google Books API, OpenLibrary) for future scaling (though out of scope for initial MVP).
    *   **Challenge:** Ensuring quality and consistency of book data.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement validation in forms and model saving. Consider data cleaning scripts if importing data.
**10.3. User Adoption Challenges (Post-development):**
    *   **Challenge:** Educating users on how to effectively use the AI chat features.
        *   **Mitigation:** Provide clear onboarding tips, example prompts, and contextual help within the AI interfaces.
    *   **Challenge:** Building trust in AI recommendations and actions.
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure transparency (clearly label AI features), allow users to override AI suggestions/actions, and provide explanations for recommendations where feasible.
