*   `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` was updated to include the PythonAnywhere domain (e.g., `<your_username>.pythonanywhere.com`) and any custom domain if configured. `DEBUG` was set to `False`.

4.5.7. **Reloading the Web App:**
    *   After making any changes to the code, WSGI configuration, static files mappings, or environment variables, the web app was reloaded using the "Reload" button on the PythonAnywhere "Web" tab to apply the changes.

4.5.8. **HTTPS:**
    *   PythonAnywhere automatically provides HTTPS for all `*.pythonanywhere.com` sites and facilitates setting up HTTPS for custom domains, ensuring secure communication.

4.5.9. **Logging and Debugging:**
    *   PythonAnywhere provides access to server logs, error logs, and web app access logs through its interface, which are essential for troubleshooting issues in the deployed environment.
    *   With `DEBUG = False`, Django sends error details to admins specified in `ADMINS` setting in `settings.py` if email is configured.
By following these steps, the BookVerse AI application was deployed and made accessible online via the PythonAnywhere platform. This PaaS solution simplified many aspects of traditional server management, allowing the team to focus more on application development and AI integration.
